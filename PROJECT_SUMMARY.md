## 🔮 Game Algorithm Details

### Probability System
1. **Initialization**: All characters start with probability = 1.0
2. **Question Selection**: AI chooses questions that best split candidates
3. **Answer Processing**:
   - ✅ **Match**: Probability × 1.2 (boost)
   - ❌ **Mismatch**: Probability × 0.3 (major penalty)
   - 🤔 **Maybe**: Probability × 1.1 (small boost)
   - ❓ **Unknown**: Probability × 0.9 (small penalty)
4. **Elimination**: Characters with probability < 0.01 are eliminated
5. **Guessing**: AI makes guess when ≤3 candidates remain or 20 questions asked

### Smart Features
- **Dynamic Questioning**: Questions adapt based on remaining candidates
- **Attribute Prioritization**: Important attributes (gender, series type) asked first
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling when no matches found
- **Learning Capability**: New characters improve future games

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Game Flow
- `POST /api/start` - Initialize new game session
- `GET /api/question/:sessionId` - Get next question
- `POST /api/answer` - Submit answer and get next question/guess
- `POST /api/feedback` - Confirm/deny guess
- `GET /api/guess/:sessionId` - Get current best guess

### Character Management
- `POST /api/character` - Add new character to database
- `GET /api/attributes` - Get all available attributes
- `GET /api/session/:sessionId` - Get session information

### Utility
